# Projects:

- Superstore  
In this project, I am conducting a market study to evaluate a sales boom. The data is located in the folder in the file "Superstore.csv," collected from Kaggle. The aim of this project is a diagnostic analysis of this boom, and at the end, I apply a regression analysis to infer and determine the percentage change of the responsible variable.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on Machine Learning and Data Analytics projects.

- I bring my experience with Statistics and Machine Learning through mini-projects that aim to explore the complexity and variety of data in the world.

- ðŸ¤“ Among my key skills, I highlight Excel, Python, R, Power BI (storytelling and related), and SQL.

- âœ… I always strive to provide new and powerful insights, operating through the lens of business and root cause analysis.

- Having worked in the data field for 3 years with various projects, I am starting my repository here. The idea of this repository is to showcase my skills.

- ðŸ“˜ Probability, Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, and Forecasting with Machine Learning will be some of the topics you'll find here today!
